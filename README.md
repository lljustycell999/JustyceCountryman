Linkedin Profile: In Progress...

Hello! Welcome to my webpage. Just as a brief introduction, I am currently in my fourth and final semester at SUNY Oswego after transferring from SUNY Jefferson in Watertown, NY. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. When I am not studying, I like to spend a good amount of time spoiling my grandma as my way of paying her back for all the spoiling she has done for me over the years. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends, learning new programming languages, and conquering new academic challenges. 

I also appreciate and enjoy any chance of becoming an exceptional team player, and sometimes leader, for group projects. When I am faced with a complex or huge task, my progress always seems to the same cycle. I first take the time to fully understand the problem, then come up with a step-by-step plan for an effective solution, then implement the strategy into the task, then check what went right or wrong, rinse and repeat until there are no more wrongs. I sometimes have to redo this cycle dozens of times just to create something valuable, but the dedication is always worth it to see what my mind is capable of. This algorithm seems universal since it applies to all kinds of real-world problems, but it presents the upmost importance in subjects that require lots of critical thinking, including computer science and mathematics.

My positive mindset will definently be put to the test in my CSC 380 - Software Engineering course that I am taking this semester because it simulates a real-world team-based programming project, where everyone needs to do their part in making something that we can all be proud of. I hope this class will also be a chance to improve my leadership skills by ensuring my teammates stay on track to complete the project with distinction, while also encouraging them to maintain a advantageous mindset similar to mine. I will post progress in the project throughout the semester on my Github profile.

## **About This Website**
This website will contain 3 primary items: All of the college level courses I have taken, links to a variety of programming projects I have completed, and my resume. I will also post some mathematical work I have done in classes that connect greatly with computer science, including discrete math, differential equations, number theory, and others.
