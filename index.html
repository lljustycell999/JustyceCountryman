            <p> Welcome to my webpage! My name is Justyce Countryman, I am a recent graduate of SUNY Oswego with a Computer Science B.A.  
                degree and a minor in Mathematics. Outside of my studies, I'm passionate about spending quality time with my 
                grandma, transforming my room into a dream man cave, and staying updated on 
                severe weather patterns (I was initally planning to study meteorology). 
                I thrive on conquering academic challenges both independently and through team environments, either of which will
                utilize and upgrade my problem-solving abilities.
                <br><br>

                One of my key approaches to tackling complex tasks involves a standard cycle of 
                understanding the problem, devising a strategic plan, implementing solutions, and 
                iteratively refining the solution until the optimal outcome is accomplished. This process, honed through 
                numerous academic and real-world endeavors, defines my commitment to exceptional success in virtually any field of study.
                <br><br>
                
                My final semester at SUNY Oswego yielded the most rewarding experience for my academic background. I worked with a
                group of four other fellow teammates on a substantial software engineering project that would be used by multiple university departments, and even
                the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. On top of that project, I also single-handedly developed an application that takes advantage of the beneficial capabilities of
                image processing. This goal was accomplished by implementing several preprocessing methods that aim to improve the readability and clarity of text document images consisting of several different forms of background noise (Noise example: Spilling coffee on a document). 
                Moreover, I worked on three projects concerning natural language processing, all of which involved training syntax datasets so that computers can be taught the art of linguistics.
                <br><br>

                Now that I have graduated, my new projects and skills will come from self-interests, curiosity, and careers. I look forward to leveraging my diverse skill set and 
                positive attitude to contribute meaningfully to future projects and initiatives.</p>

            <ul class="indent">
                <li><b>Gravity Waves Analysis Tool (January 2024 to Current)</b> - This was my team-based, semester-long project for CSC 380 - Software Engineering at SUNY Oswego. 
                    This project is a very benefical and easy-to-use web application designed for individuals eager 
                    to conduct research on radiosonde weather balloon files in order to detect possible gravity waves.
                    The user simply provides a text file containing weather balloon data, and the application will display
                    a downloadable PDF containing several graphs, two hodographs, a path of the weather balloon, and if possible,
                    additional parameters like energy, wavelength, intrinsic frequency, and many others. Other than the weather balloon path, the PDF will display information
                    for both the stratosphere and troposphere. The motivation for this project was primarily driven by the 2024 Solar Eclipse. I worked on this project with four other teammates and I am very proud of what was created as a result. This project is still
                    in progress because we are testing for any potential bugs. If you are interested in meteorology, physics, or atmospheric science, or simply want to learn more about gravity
                    waves and weather balloon data analysis, you are welcome to check out the project's GitHub repository.

                <br>
                <li><b>Text Document Enhancer (January 2024 to May 2024)</b> - This was my semester-long project for CSC 474 - Image Processing at SUNY Oswego. 
                    The problem I wanted to solve was looking for ways to remove noisy backgrounds (coffee stains, crumples, folding 
                    creases, etc.) from text documents. The final result was an application containing nine subprograms. Eight of 
                    these subprograms involve user-adjustable image preprocessing methods, while the last one automatically attempts 
                    to enhance the image without any parameters. This project primarily uses two libraries, OpenCV, for image 
                    preprocessing, and PyTesseract, for text extraction. With these tools and a lot of image dataset experimentation, 
                    I developed an application that handles the general types of background noise. The project also tries to ensure that any 
                    preprocessed text document images are both user-readable and computer-readable, but keep in mind that there is no 
                    "one-size-fits-all" solution to image processing.
                    <ul class="indentAgain">

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) (February 2024 to May 2024)</b> - In my CSC 350 - Computational Linguistics course, I took 
                    on three different projects to train extremely large syntax datasets so that the computer can try to strive for gold-standards. These projects include predicting labels, part-of-speech tag sequences, and semantic interpretations.
                    Each project considered several NLP algorithms and were applied through the usage of multiple Python libraries to examine which algorithms provide the highest accuracies.
                    Unfortunately, at the request of my CSC 350 professor, I cannot share any of my code used in the projects.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Disco Dance Floor Screensaver (November 2023 to December 2023)</b> - This project was done as my final homework submission for the 
                    CSC 470 - Computer Graphics course at SUNY Oswego. This WebGL project was based on a personal passion for 
                    lights and disco. As a result, I created a disco dance floor screensaver. This project needed three WebGL 
                    subprograms, one for the color-changing tiles, one for the hanging and rotating 3D disco ball, and one 
                    for the starry-night background. Aligning the project to fully fit the web browser required additional 
                    HTML and CSS adjustments.

                    implementing and upgrading a Wikipedia website recommendation system (CSC 365), combining genetic algorithms with Java concurrency (CSC 375), and documenting my entire process with finding vulenerabilities on a mock computer system
                    and recommending potential solutions (CSC 333).

            <h5>Lastly, I want to list a handful of advantageous software tools that I am comfortable with at this time. Just like with programming languages, one of my strongest skills is learning software in a timely fashion, 
                which includes applying them to real-world situations. Therefore, I am obviously not limited to these tools.</h5>

            <p>In terms of operating systems, I have engaged with a lot of Windows and MacOS features. 
                I also have some Linux experience, but because it has been quite a while since I last used Linux, 
                I will need to refresh on its key capabilities.</p>
